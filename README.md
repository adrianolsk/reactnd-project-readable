# Readable Project

This is my implementation of the Udacity Readable project for the React Nanodegree

## Running the project

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window start the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
